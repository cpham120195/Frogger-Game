# Frogger
# Overview 

Frogger, a classic arcade action game that is known and loved by countless of people. This is my first project and game for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Course. Frogger is a simple browser based game where the objective is to save the frog by crossing the road and river while dodging dangerous obstacles. 

## How To Play

Start the game by using the arrow keys as a keystroke to jump the frog. The objective of the game is to dodge the obstacles by making it to the otherside. Each time the frog is safe by reaching the otherside, your score will increase and so will gamespeed. If the frog is struck by an obstacle or falls into the water then score will reset.
